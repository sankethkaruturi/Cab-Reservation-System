## Introduction
Booking __cabs__ is an efficient way to travel between different places. Services like [__Lyft__](https://www.lyft.com/drive-with-lyft?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=PAID_DAX_SRCH_US_PRO_WEB_DESK_BRND_LYFT_EXACT&adgroup=lyft_NA_NA&utm_term=lyft&device=c&matchtype=e&targetid=aud-445253257374:kwd-158399963&loc_physical_ms=9061331&loc_interest_ms=&network=g&devicemodel=&adposition=&campaign_id=1447389321&ad_id=511938195020&adgroup_id=54874112525&placement=&ref=&adname=210401_SC_RSA_MMWL_V1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2ZCOBhDiARIsAMRfv9Lek_vwIst6HIq_bu11IKFQomD7eDRxzlduC8fHNMHJz6XYdI4DbD0aAtBREALw_wcB) offer reliable transportation options to ensure timely arrival at your destination. People from various parts of the world rely on cab services to move around. Therefore, it is crucial to prioritize customer satisfaction by providing excellent service.

## Challenges
* One of the __challenges__ with the cab reservation system is that an user is not able to get an accurate estimated time it takes for the driver to pickup in their current location. 
* Furthermore, user interface (UI) for cab reservation is often complex which makes the user enter a lot of details before even booking a ride initially.
* As a result, this slows down the process overall of picking an __user__ respectively. 
 
 ## Solution 
* We considered this project and thought of combating these challenges with the aid of __MySQL__ and __Flask__. 
* We've built an interactive UI that takes minimal information about the user along with providing the most accurate estimate of the wait time. 
* As an end product, we get an UI that is quite easy for the user to understand and book a ride. 
* In addition to this, machine learning is used to get the accurate estimates of the time it takes for the driver to arrive on time. 

## ðŸ‘‰ Directions to download the repository and run the notebook 

This is for the Washington Bike Demand Prediction repository. But the same steps could be followed for this repository. 

1. You'll have to download and install Git which could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/68ec804a501be2c8861643e707166d33a5d0ccd2/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(14).png" width = "600"/>
 
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository. I would like to store it in the "Git Folder" location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/68ec804a501be2c8861643e707166d33a5d0ccd2/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(15).png" width = "600" />

3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/68ec804a501be2c8861643e707166d33a5d0ccd2/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(16).png" width = "600" />


4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link to the repository.

5. The link to the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be an HTML link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone HTML" where the HTML is replaced by the link to this repository. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/68ec804a501be2c8861643e707166d33a5d0ccd2/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(17).png" width = "600" />

6. After successfully downloading the repository, there should be a folder with the name of the repository as can be seen below.

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(19).png" width = "600" />

7. Once the repository is downloaded, go to the start button and search for "Anaconda Prompt" if you have anaconda installed. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(20).png" width = "600" />

8. Later, open the Jupyter notebook by writing "Jupyter notebook" in the Anaconda prompt. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(21).png" width = "600" />

9. Now the following would open with a list of directories. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(22).png" width = "600" />

10. Search for the location where you have downloaded the repository. Be sure to open that folder. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot%20(12).png" width = "600" />

11. You might now run the .ipynb files present in the repository to open the notebook and the python code present in it. 

&emsp;&emsp; <img src = "https://github.com/Sankethprasad09/Images/blob/60b3eb7b600fef4bc619331ba5caf21e93b149ef/washington_bike_prediction_images/Screenshot(13).png" width = "600" />

That's it, you should be able to read the code now. Thanks.
